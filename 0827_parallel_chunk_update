Updating Large Tables in Parallel
The DBMS_PARALLEL_EXECUTE package lets you incrementally update the data in a large table in parallel, in two high-level steps:

Group sets of rows in the table into smaller chunks.
Apply the desired UPDATE statement to the chunks in parallel, committing each time you have finished processing a chunk.
This technique is recommended whenever you are updating a lot of data. Its advantages are:

You lock only one set of rows at a time, for a relatively short time, instead of locking the entire table.

You do not lose work that has been done if something fails before the entire operation finishes.

You reduce rollback space consumption.

You improve performance.
