1. Change join type from NL (nested loop) to sort ordered join==> 15min to 3 seconds

with t1 as (
  select date1, kde,column1 
  from big_mv1 where condition1
),
t2 as(
   select date1, kde,column2 ....
  from big_mv1 where condition2
)
select * 
from t1,t2 
where 
  t1.kde=t2.kde
and t1.date1.t2.date1


##
Issue: if there is only one where condition, speed fast
    if date1 condition added, performance poor
    
execution plan:
  NL : t1 & t2
  
Solution,
 adding 
      order by date1, kde for both t1 & t2
 adding      
 /*+ use_merge(t1,t2) */   for main select 
 
 15min to 3 seconds

For two small table join, sort order obvious  MUCH fast than NL (8000*1000==> almost 1 million )
